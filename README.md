# Titanic Data Pipeline Project

This project aims to build an end-to-end data pipeline to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of the Titanic dataset into a PostgreSQL database using Python scripts.

The pipeline is designed to showcase key data engineering skills, including data extraction, data transformation, database management, and logging.

The dataset is originated from kaggle via this link > https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv .
