# Titanic Data Pipeline Project

This project aims to build an end-to-end data pipeline to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of the Titanic dataset into a PostgreSQL database using Python scripts.

The pipeline is designed to showcase key data engineering skills, including data extraction, data transformation, database management, and logging.
